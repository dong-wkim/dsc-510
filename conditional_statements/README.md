# Week 3
## 3.2 Programming Assignment
The purpose of the program this week is to demonstrate that you can implement “if statements” and try blocks in a program.  This program will build on what you accomplished in Week 2. Your program will calculate the cost of fiber optic cable installation by multiplying the number of feet needed by the price per foot. The price per foot will be dependent on how many feet requested by the user. Using if statements, you will evaluate a bulk discount. You will prompt the user for the number of fiber optic cable they need installed. Using the default value of $.95 per foot calculate the total expense for any number of feet up to and including 100 feet. If the user purchases more than 100 feet they are charged $0.85 per foot. If the user purchases more than 250 feet they will be charged $0.75 per foot. If they purchase more than 500 feet, they will be charged $0.55 per foot.
Your program must have a header.
Your program must adhere to PEP8 guidelines especially as it pertains to variable names.
Display a welcome message for your program.
Retrieve the company name from the user.
Retrieve the number of feet of fiber optic cable to be installed from the user.
Evaluate the total cost based upon the number of feet requested, keeping in mind that the cost per foot will depend on the number of feet requested.
Print a receipt for the user including the company name, number of feet of fiber to be installed, and total cost in a legible format.
Your program must use try blocks to catch any ValueError exceptions as you convert user input to a numeric value.
Must have good coding practices.
